🌱 Smart Irrigation Ecosystem

Predictive • Solar-Powered • Crop-Aware Irrigation System

📌 Overview

The Smart Irrigation Ecosystem is an IoT- and Machine Learning-based solution designed to optimize agricultural irrigation using real-time sensing, predictive analytics, and renewable solar energy. Traditional irrigation methods rely on fixed schedules and manual decisions, often leading to water wastage, crop stress, and dependency on unreliable grid electricity. This project transforms irrigation into a data-driven, automated, and sustainable process.

The system continuously monitors soil moisture and environmental conditions, predicts future irrigation requirements based on crop growth stages, and automatically controls water supply. Solar-powered operation ensures uninterrupted functionality in rural and power-deficient regions.

🎯 Problem Statement

Conventional irrigation systems fail to adapt to dynamic agricultural conditions such as crop growth stages, soil drying behavior, weather variations, and power availability. This results in inefficient water usage, energy wastage, reduced crop yield, and increased farmer workload. There is a need for an intelligent, predictive, and energy-independent irrigation system that can support sustainable farming practices.
